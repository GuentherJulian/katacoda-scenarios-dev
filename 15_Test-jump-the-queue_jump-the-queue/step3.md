 Now you have to open another terminal. Click on the cd command twice and you will change to jump-the-queue/java/jtqj/server in terminal 2 automatically.
 Alternatively you can click on the + next to `IDE`, choose the option `Open New Terminal` and run the cd command afterwards. 


`cd jump-the-queue/java/jtqj/server`{{execute T2}}

Start the server in terminal 2 by running the maven command 'mvn spring-boot:run'.

Because this terminal runs the server we will not use it for any other command.
 

` mvn spring-boot:run`{{execute T2 }}

This will take some time.
