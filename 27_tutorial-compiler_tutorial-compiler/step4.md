Switch to the &#39;tutorials&#39;-repository and repeat all the previous steps:

https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials.git

- Fork the &#39;tutorials&#39;-repository
- Copy the &#39;tutorials&#39;-URL







Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials.git`{{execute T1}}

After this step you should have both repositories in the same folder next to each other.





Install the package typescript.

`npm install -g  typescript`{{execute T1}}

Due to the argument '-g' the package will be installed globally.
This may take some time.
