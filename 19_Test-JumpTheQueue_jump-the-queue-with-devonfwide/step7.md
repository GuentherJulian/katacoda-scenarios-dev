Run the frontend server.


 Now you have to open another terminal. Click on the cd command twice and you will change to devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular in terminal 3 automatically.
 Alternatively you can click on the + next to `IDE`, choose the option `Open New Terminal` and run the cd command afterwards. 


`cd devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular`{{execute T3}}


Now build and start the app
 

`devon ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`{{execute T3 }}

For your local projects you wouldn't add '--host 0.0.0.0' and '--disable-host-check' to the ng command.

Now you can open the following link to use the app.
