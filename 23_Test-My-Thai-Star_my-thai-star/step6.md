Run the frontend server.


Now you have to open another terminal. Click on the cd command twice and you will change to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main/my-thai-star/angular&#39; in terminal 3 automatically. Alternatively you can click on the + next to &#39;IDE&#39;, choose the option &#39;Open New Terminal&#39; and run the cd command afterwards. 


`cd devonfw/workspaces/main/my-thai-star/angular`{{execute T3}}


Now build and start the app
 

`devon ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`{{execute T3 }}

For your local projects you wouldn't add '--host 0.0.0.0' and '--disable-host-check' to the ng command.


Now you can open the following link to use the app.
